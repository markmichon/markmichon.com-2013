This project came about from the mutual needs of a fellow faculty member as well as an opportunity to appear on [This Week in Webdesign](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzIqpZUENXw). The goals for each source varied slightly, but the basis was a basic HTML and CSS page, well formed and semantic, that could be used to describe the process and concepts of basic front-end development to beginners.

The topic spawned from the need for something universal, non-technical, and with content freely available in the public domain (or at the very least easily licensed).

##Challenges
The biggest challenge came with designing something that was simple enough to discuss in a short period of time, as well as complex enough to successfully demonstrate many html elements without overwhelming the student.

There seems to be a trend in most basic html/css courses that results in poorly designed demonstration sites, about overly technical topics. My goal was to create something that was both simple, fun, and nice to look at.
